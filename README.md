Project Overview:

   The University Research Cell Management System (URCMS) is a full-stack web application designed to streamline research workflows in academic institutions. It provides a centralized platform for students, teachers, reviewers, and administrators to manage research proposals, papers, and team collaborations.

Key highlights:

   1. Role-based access (Admin, Teacher, Reviewer, Student, General User).
   2. Secure authentication and email verification.
   3. Proposal and paper submission with reviewer assignment.
   4. Team collaboration and supervision features.
   5. Proposal and paper review process ensures quality standards: all submitted proposals and papers are evaluated by assigned reviewers and are either accepted for publication or rejected based on adherence to academic and institutional standards.
